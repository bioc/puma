Description: Most analyses of Affymetrix GeneChip data are based on
        point estimates of expression levels and ignore the uncertainty
        of such estimates. By propagating uncertainty to downstream
        analyses we can improve results from microarray analyses. For
        the first time, the puma package makes a suite of uncertainty
        propagation methods available to a general audience. puma also
        offers improvements in terms of scope and speed of execution
        over previously available uncertainty propagation methods.
        Included are summarisation, differential expression detection,
        clustering and PCA methods, together with useful plotting and
        data manipulation functions.
