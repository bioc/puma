PRE-HISTORY

Parts of the puma package were originally created by Xuejun Liu as the following
separate R packages: mmgmos, pplr, pumaclust, as well as Matlab code (by Guido
Sanguinetti) for NPPCA. This legacy code is still available from the project
website http://umber.sbs.man.ac.uk/resources/puma/.
